# Kewal Jayshankar Mishra

AI Scientist focused on generative and agent-based methods for healthcare and life-science R&D. I design ethical, scalable AI pipelines that transform complex biomedical data into actionable insights—compressing weeks of manual analysis into minutes and enabling precision-driven decisions for clinicians and researchers.

## Selected Highlights

- 99% pass rate on a 240-sample benchmark; reduced inference-to-report time from 7 days to under 60 minutes (Ayass BioScience).
- Built role-based agentic system with ReAct + self-reflection, tools/APIs, RAG on Milvus; 90% reduction in manual curation.
- LLaMA2 + LoRA for protein classification (86% accuracy) on SLURM HPC with DeepSpeed; Nsight-driven optimizations.
- Automated high-dimensional flow cytometry gating with PyTorch (F1: 0.97) and a biologist-in-the-loop retraining pipeline.
- IJCCI 2024 Best Paper Award (NCTA 2024) for multimodal anomaly detection in sewage plant data.
